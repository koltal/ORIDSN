                    <h3>History of ORIDSAN</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p><ReadMore>Despite the diversity of perspectives of OR, its unique activity, which informs the kind of basic training, is fundamentally the attack of science on operational problems existing in any endeavour, civilian or military, Business, politics, industry, general administration, or even in self-management. This attack on science originates in the activities of the pioneers of OR.
                        Indeed, literature is replete with tracing the origin of formal OR to the World War II exigencies that compelled enlisting the contribution of active scientists in fighting the war. Science’s gift to humanity is research, which is the bedrock of developments over the ages, especially in modern times. It was this research that scientists during the World War faithful brought to bear on military operations of the time, which yielded sounding results that recommended a formalization of such activities and their spread to other endeavours, even after the war. Thus, two values are fundamental to OR: Its science bases, pervasive implication, and applicability.
                        Science is fundamentally about systematically searching for facts (information gathering and data recording), and organizing such facts (data) to deduce further attributes that are factually verified and valid. This is what Research is all about. Our field, OR, seeks faithfully apply this approach and methodology to operations in any concept. The use of scientific research in tackling formalized operational problems in diverse situations since World War II has led to the formalization of the experiences into what we now know as OR problem models and solution techniques, most of which are mathematical. Thus, OR today comprises:
                    1.Its philosophy of factually and systematically analyzing operations to tackle them.
                    2.Its methodology of formally representing the such problem as the basis for reasoning out the solutions.
                    3.Its techniques are special procedures, usually derived from appropriate mathematical theories, as the tools for deducing solutions to the problems using the models.
                    4.Application, which pervasively is an operation in any situation.
                    It is clear from the above that OR has something for everybody. You may be a sophisticated mathematician and yet be a significant Operational Researcher.

                        Career opportunity in Operation Research abounds in all fields of endeavour, every area and sector of society, and the economy. This is so because OR is fundamentally about solving operational problems and offering a basis for efficient decision–making and management generally.
                        In this case, whenever and wherever there are objectives to be achieved and a desire to do efficiently, OR has a role to play by analyzing the system scientifically for which the operation is to be carried out.
                        A specific aspect of Operations Research that offers ample career opportunities includes:
                        1.General application of science to solving operational problems of organizations and even individuals;
                        2.Skill in using specific techniques of Operations Research such as simulation, mathematical programming, conflict management techniques, etc.
                        3.Addressing problems generally through the use of Operations Research methodology;
                        4.Promoting the use of Operations Research and marketing it to all sectors of the economy and society.
                        5.Teaching OR formally in universities and polytechnics and formally at training workshops.
                        The Objectives of the Institute
                        The purpose for which the Institute is established includes but is not limited to the following:
                        i.develop, advance and give advisory services to a person carrying out research activities,
                        ii.provide a high standard of competent practice and conduct to members of the Institute,
                        iii.Research, write and publish articles, journals, magazines and books to advance research in management practice.
                        iv.To plan, promote and organize seminars, workshops and enlightenment programs considered appropriate for general research development in management practices.
                        v.To establish and operate training centres for members of the Institute and those from the general public who may want to choose Operations Research as a career.
                        Powers and Responsibilities: The Institute, a non-profit organization committed to the development of and promotion of good value and the virtue of integrity in Nigeria and outside the country, is, among others, statutorily conferred with the following powers and responsibilities:
